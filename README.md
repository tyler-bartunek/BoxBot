# BoxBot

## Statement of Purpose
BoxBot is an open-source platform intended to lower the barrier of entry to learning mobile robotics and controls.
Through the use of a standardized mounting system, creators have the freedom to use either the pre-built demos 
to get a cheap bot up and running or develop their own, compatible platforms. 

## Description of Modules

1. Wheels: This module consists of DC motors and wheels.
2. QuadBox: Offers quadrapedal motion through use of servomotors
3. HexaBox: Requires six mounts, offers six-legged locomotion through use of servomotors.

## Hardware files
STEP files for all prepared modules will be made available upon finalization.
